Readme
======

These are some of the extensions and utilities I've recently built (for my own usage) for Laravel 4.

Usage
=====

You can directly `git clone` it, or better add it as a submodule:

```bash
git submodule add git@github.com:elboletaire/laravel-utils-and-extensions.git app/library/Elboletaire
```
